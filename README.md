# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with JavaScript

*Using an if/else block (aka 'conditional statements'), create the logic behind the classic game, Rock, Paper, Scissors.*

## Conditional Statements Overview
* Let you control the “flow” of a program to determine which code runs and when it runs
* Let you make a program behave differently based on circumstances in the program
* Example: User types into a form or the score in a game can change how the program runs



## Task
Assuming the computer always throws paper, write the conditional statement that will console log out one of the following messages based on what you change the me value too.

Looks like a tie!
I win!
Computer wins!

Keep in mind that:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beat paper
Paper beats rock
